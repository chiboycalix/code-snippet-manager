# Code Snippet Manager
The Code Snippet Manager is a utility app designed to help developers organize and manage their code snippets for quick reference and reuse. The app provides a user-friendly interface where developers can create, store, categorize, and retrieve code snippets easily.

## Key Features
**Snippet Creation**: Users can create new code snippets by providing a title, description, and the actual code itself. They can also specify the programming language or framework associated with the snippet.

**Categorization**: Snippets can be organized into categories or tags to facilitate better organization and easier searchability. Users can assign one or more categories to each snippet.

**Syntax Highlighting**: The app supports syntax highlighting, which means that code snippets will be displayed with proper formatting and color highlighting based on the selected programming language.

**Search Functionality**: Users can search for specific snippets using keywords, titles, descriptions, or tags. The search functionality allows developers to quickly find the relevant snippets they need.

**Code Preview**: The app provides a preview feature that allows users to view the code snippet without leaving the app's interface. This helps developers quickly review the code and determine its usefulness.

**Edit and Update**: Users have the ability to edit and update existing code snippets. They can modify the code, change the title or description, and update the assigned categories/tags.

**Export and Import**: The app supports exporting and importing snippets to enable easy backup or sharing with other users. Snippets can be exported in a standardized format, such as JSON or XML, and imported back into the app when needed.

**User Authentication**: To ensure privacy and data security, the app can implement user authentication mechanisms, such as login credentials or integration with existing authentication systems.
